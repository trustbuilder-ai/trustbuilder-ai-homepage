# Trust Builder

Stress-Test Your AI Before the World Does. Build Trust in AI Through Safe, Competitive Stress-Testing.

## The Challenge

AI is moving fast — but trust isn’t keeping up. Your customers, your brand, your business: they’re all at risk when
your AI says or does the wrong thing. But AI mistakes aren’t bugs. They’re judgment errors. And those require a human touch.

## Our Solution

Trust Builder is a competitive platform that uncovers hidden risks in your AI before bad headlines — or bad actors — do. \
It enables organizations to identify and manage risks in large language models (LLMs) by simulating real-world challenges 
in controlled, gamified environments. In a time where AI systems are increasingly used in decision-making and automation,
we offer a structured, ethical, and user-driven way to pressure-test these models—before real risks surface in production.

- We turn AI safety into a war game:
- Real users simulate real threats
- Secure environments mimic real-world risk
- The result: you see how your AI behaves under pressure, without real consequences

## Why It Matters

- Avoid brand disasters before they happen
- Meet compliance standards with real safety evidence
- Build user trust by proving your AI is tested, not just trained

## How It Works

✔️ Free Tier – Join red-team competitions, test open models, learn from others \
💡 Premium – Custom test scenarios, reporting tools, private model testing \
🏆 Earn credits for uncovering real issues, and reinvest them in deeper testing

## Who It’s For

- AI builders who care about safety
- Enterprises adopting AI at scale
- Security & risk leaders preparing for the unexpected

## What Sets Us Apart

We combine human intuition + ethical simulation to surface what machines alone can't.
Others test _features_ — we test _failures_.

## Bottom Line

You can’t trust AI until you’ve tested it under pressure. Trust Builder makes that easy, ethical, and even fun.
