# Trust Builder

Building Trust in AI Through Safe, Competitive Stress-Testing

## Overview

**Trust Builder** is an AI safety platform that enables organizations to identify and manage risks in
large language models (LLMs) by simulating real-world challenges in controlled, gamified environments.
In a time where AI systems are increasingly used in decision-making and automation, we offer a structured,
ethical, and user-driven way to pressure-test these models‚Äîbefore real risks surface in production.

## The Problem

Modern AI models, while powerful, can behave unpredictably. Left unchecked, they may respond in harmful
or biased ways, or even misinterpret user intent‚Äîpotentially triggering serious consequences. Existing
tools for AI safety often fail to harness the human intuition needed to uncover these edge cases.

## Our Solution

**Trust Builder** offers a secure, competitive platform where users‚Äîdevelopers, researchers, or enterprises ‚Äî
can test AI models under simulated ‚ÄúWar Games.‚Äù Participants are challenged to reveal AI vulnerabilities
through creative, controlled scenarios, helping expose model weaknesses before bad actors do.

Key features include:

- A curated set of mock tools and environments designed to safely simulate real-world risks
- A reward-based competition system to attract top talent and foster collaboration
- Intuitive tools to help users track, label, and share discovered vulnerabilities
- Ethical oversight to ensure tests reflect real-world threats without encouraging harmful behaviors

## Why Now

AI adoption is accelerating, but trust hasn‚Äôt kept pace. High-profile failures, from biased outputs to
hallucinated content, erode public and regulatory confidence. Trust Builder answers this moment with a
people-first approach: empowering communities to uncover what AI might get wrong‚Äîbefore it matters.

## Business Model

**Trust Builder** follows a freemium model:

- Free Tier: Open participation in red-teaming competitions and access to baseline tools
- Premium Features: Advanced analytics, collaborative workspaces, and premium testing environments available via subscription or pay-per-use
- Incentives: Successful participants earn platform credits, unlocking advanced features

## Target Customers

- AI Companies seeking a proactive, ethical approach to model testing
- Enterprises adopting AI and needing internal validation tools
- Research labs and government agencies focused on AI safety

## Ethics at the Core

Unlike platforms that gamify harmful behavior for attention, Trust Builder is grounded in ethical boundaries.
We promote scenarios with real-world relevance, not sensationalism. From responsible disclosure to competition
category review, ethics guide every step of our product and community development.

## The Competitive Edge

Where others rely solely on automation, we amplify human insight. Our crowdsourced model taps into diverse
perspectives to surface risks traditional systems miss. With built-in frameworks, ethical rigor, and a strong
incentive system, Trust Builder brings the transparency and accountability the AI industry desperately needs.
